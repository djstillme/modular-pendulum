# Modular-Pendulum

Python script used to create n-body pendulum simulations in any media format supported by the [Manim](https://www.manim.community/) library (mp4, gif, etc).
The equations of motions are found using Kane's method via the [Sympy](https://www.sympy.org) library. The Integration is done using [Scipy](https://scipy.org/) and the animation is done in ManimCE.

## 🪄 Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python version > 3.0.0
- [conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html) package manager

### 🐾 Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Clone this repository to your local machine**

```
git clone https://github.com/djstillme/modular-pendulum.git
```

2. **Resolve dependencies by executing the following in the project directory**
   
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Ensure that you have the [conda-forge](https://conda-forge.org/) channel enabled, and `conda channel_priority` set to **flexible**
before trying to install the environment or it may not generate correctly — you may also need the [libmamba solver](https://conda.github.io/conda-libmamba-solver/user-guide/) enabled in your conda config.

## 📦 Usage

**Generate the animation using the following**

```
manim Animate.py Animate
```

After the animation has finished rendering, the output will be placed into the `media` folder in the projects root directory.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure you run this command in the `modp` conda environment, or whatever virtualenv you are using to manage the dependencies.

By default, manim generates an mp4 at 1080p at 60fps, if you want to change this — you can add parameters to the previous command, see the [ManimCE API](https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/guides/configuration.html) for more details. Keep in mind that whatever fps you set in `config.ini` should match what you execute the previous command with. For example if you want to render a 30 second animation at 144fps in 1440p you would need to edit **duration** and **fps** in `config.ini` to be 30/144 respectively and then execute the following command:

```
manim Animate.py Animate --fps 144 -r 2560,1440
```

> [!NOTE]
> The rendering time for the animation increases with the number of frames (`duration` × `fps`). Depending on these factors and your hardware’s performance, it may take anywhere from a few minutes to several hours to be fully completed.

### 🔧 Parameters

The customizable parameters are located in `config.ini`, and should be formatted as seen below in the **Example** column. A list of predefined colors can be found in the Manim documentation [here](https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/reference/manim.utils.color.manim_colors.html).
